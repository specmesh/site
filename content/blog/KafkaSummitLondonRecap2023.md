  ### Looking back at Kafka Summit 2023 (OSO) 



Kafka Summit 2023: Key takeaways
Sion — We joined this event as a startup sponsor, organised by Confluent, one of OSO’s key technology partners. We brought our technical Kafka experts to explain the importance of Apache Kafka best practices, and outlined how OSO professional services can increase the success of Kafka adoption in your organisation. Over two days, over 1,500 Kafka enthusiasts attended a combination of workshops, presentations and networking sessions –  I’ll distil the opening keynote, outline what is currently happening and what is on the roadmap for the upcoming future.
