## AWS Datazone vs SpecMesh OS for Kafka (fight!)

AWS Data Zone appears to be a solid representation of AWS embracing the 'data mesh' concept, featuring an array of well-suited features for the AWS native environment. Yet, for those of us deeply immersed in the Event Streaming realm, particularly those eager to construct a 'streaming data mesh' with Apache Kafka, there's a different angle to explore.
I invite you to read my blog post, where I conduct a comparative analysis of AWS DataZone and SpecMesh OS for Apache Kafka. This evaluation delves into their respective capabilities and offerings, shedding light on the ideal choice for your specific streaming data mesh needs.
