  ### SpecMesh announced at Big Data London, October 2022 

Today, we are excited to announce the launch of SpecMesh: a specification-driven data mesh methodology for the enterprise. SpecMesh is an open-source project that uses specifications to capture, provision and serve data products within a data mesh.  The project was launched at Big Data LDN 2022. The project has been initiated by OSO, but we are looking to the data mesh community to help steer the roadmap and evolve the product.
