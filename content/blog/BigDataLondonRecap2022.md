  ### Looking back at Big Data London 2022 (OSO) 

Big Data LDN 2022: Key takeaways

When you capture new ideas, you want to share them with others. Back for the first time since the pandemic, Big Data LDN attracted more than 3000 vendors and experts for two days packed with data strategy, live speakers, and networking events. As I absorbed new ideas, I realised that a quick breakdown of the conference might provide you with new frameworks to more efficiently manage your data. In this blog, I’ll distill the opening keynote, outline OSO’s SpecMesh launch, and share tips to help you make the most of your next in-person conference.
