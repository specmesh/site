        We are some of the world's most experienced streaming engineers. We have been in the streaming space since 2016, worked at Confluent, committers on Apache Kafka, with a combined total of over 50 Kafka projects.
        SpecMesh is the culmination of that experience where we put all that into an OpenSource project, automate it and make your Kafka resources a Data Mesh.

## This Is Our Story

Many years ago, we, the creators of SpecMesh, all moved into Kafka Projects (circa 2016). While being an extraordinary technology, there has always been confusion about determining sizing (partitioning), modeling data into topics, retention, and general configuration. Kafka is not opinionated. This is exemplified by the fact that when consulting on project after project, we see the same mistakes repeated. Unless there is a simple and clear methodology on how to build Kafka apps, developers learning on the job will continue to make the same errors. Like most things, hindsight is a wonderful thing. We have participated in some incredibly innovative projects and have also seen the results of a lack of experience and foresight.

SpecMesh seeks to resolve this, leveling the playing field by proposing a standard for building, configuring, and running large-scale Kafka apps - with the aim to avoid these common mistakes and simplify processes. It uses all the expected best practices, including domain modeling, structured hierarchical topics, implicit security, chargeback support, GitOps, and more. It's a lot to build, and we are on a journey to make it happen.

Affirmation is everywhere. We see it in many customer engagements, meetups, and conferences.
