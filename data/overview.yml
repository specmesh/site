title : "Data Mesh meets streaming data"
enable: true
subtitle: >
    For organisations to successfully adopt data mesh, setting up and maintaining infrastructure needs to be easy.
    We believe the best way to achieve this is to leverage the learnings from building a ‘central nervous system‘, commonly used in modern data-streaming ecosystems. This approach formalises and automates the manual parts of building a data mesh.

summary: >
  SpecMesh combines Kafka best practice, blue prints, domain driven design concepts, data modelling, GitOps and chargeback. But rather than talk about it, we decided to build it!

     It takes a team many years to reach Level 5, the "Central Nervous System" stage. SpecMesh accelerates this journey

     Data Mesh aligns closely with the functionality required for constructing a Central Nervous System. It enhances discovery by incorporating data cataloging and introducing federated governance

     Data Mesh is a confusing space. The 4 Pillars are the only thing that is truly agreed upon. SpecMesh addresses them all

     Once each Spec (Data Product) is provisioned, the meta data (spec + schemas) is published to a data catalogue to enable discovery

     As the organisation grows more and more Specs (Data Products) are deployed where services emit events over domain structured '_public' and/or '_protected' topics

     Each team owns and manages their own AsyncAPI spec. The spec is provisioned using GitHub Actions. 
     The build workflow provisions each environment as the spec is promoted
