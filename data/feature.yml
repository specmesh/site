  - name: "Scale across the organisation"

  - name: "Simplified Kafka resource modelling"
    description: >
      SpecMesh will model topics, schemas, and permissions as a unified configuration, rather than using the disparate configurations employed by other tools.

  - name: "Chargeback support"
    description: >
      By modeling a collection of topics under a single app that uses a common hierarchy, SpecMesh is able to report on storage and consumption metrics that can be used to build chargeback systems.

  - name: "Self-governance"
    description: >
                Topic names can use a '_protected' label, this allows a tag to be incorporated where the application owner can grant permissions to other domain-ids (principals)
    icon: "ti-lock"
    link: "https://specmesh.github.io/specmesh-build/"
  - name: "Observability"
    description: >
      SpecMesh will support a dataflow-centric visualization of all related specifications (apps), their relationships, as well as producers and consumers (coming soon).
